# allen-redux-store

The JavaScript library Redux has maintained itself as in fact the business standard for managing large state in bigger projects using React. Because of this, we took the time to re-create and refactor an e-commerce app first introduced in a class example using Redux. Changes were made to all component files found in the server side of the code, using all necessary dependencies and regrouping of leftover React hooks.
